# bjlggr
Python script for generating a markdown entry of my [bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) daily log.

For a sample output of the script, check the `yesterday.md` file. The generated
template allows for monitoring _sleep-wake_ hours as well as _food intake_
(in my own usage) throughout the day.

## Usage Notes
- Categories include:
  - Events
  - Tasks
  - Notes
  - Thoughts
- List one item per line including additional markdown formatting as needed.
- To move on to the next category, press enter twice.
- To nest a bullet, include a `-` (and space) for every item to be nested
